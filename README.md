## Background

In the era of big data and cloud computing, a large number of companies choose to build data warehouses on public cloud platforms (such as Amazon Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, etc.) and use OLAP technology to perform efficient data analysis.

How to conduct data analysis with lower cost and higher efficiency and speed up data decision-making is of great significance to improving the competitiveness of enterprises.

At the same time, a wide variety of OLAP technologies have emerged in the industry (such as Spark-SQL, Presto, Apache Kylin, etc.). When selecting technologies, companies need to evaluate the performance and cost of different OLAP technologies.

This project is a bemchmark framework for performance cost evaluation of OLAP technology on the cloud.
